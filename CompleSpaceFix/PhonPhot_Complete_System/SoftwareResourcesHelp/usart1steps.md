## Steps for Integration

1. USART1 Initialization Function in `usart.c`

   Look for the USART1 Initialization Function: This is typically named something like `MX_USART1_UART_Init` in the `usart.c` file. It contains the setup for USART1, including baud rate, word length, stop bits, parity, and hardware control settings.

   Migrate Initialization Code: Copy the `MX_USART1_UART_Init` function or its equivalent from the example project's `usart.c` to your current project's `usart.c` file. Ensure to also copy any global variables or definitions related to USART1 used within this function.

2. GPIO Configuration for USART1 in `usart.c` or `main.c`

   Identify GPIO Configuration: Initialization code will configure PB6 and PB7 for alternate function (AF) mode to serve as USART1_TX and USART1_RX. This configuration might be part of the `MX_USART1_UART_Init` function or set up in the `main.c` during system initialization.

   Copy GPIO Setup: Ensure the GPIO setup for PB6 and PB7 (mode, pull-up/down, speed, alternate function) is copied to your current project. Adjustments might be needed if other configurations or uses of PB6/PB7 exist.

3. Clock Configuration

   USART1 and GPIO Clocks: The example project will include code to enable the clock for USART1 and GPIOB (since PB6 and PB7 are part of GPIOB). This is usually done with calls like `__HAL_RCC_USART1_CLK_ENABLE()` and `__HAL_RCC_GPIOB_CLK_ENABLE()`.

   Ensure Clocks are Enabled: Verify and copy over the clock enable statements for both USART1 and GPIOB into your current project, if not already enabled.

4. HAL & Other Peripheral Initializations

   HAL Library Initialization: The `main.c` file must initialize the HAL library (`HAL_Init()`) and configure system clocks (`SystemClock_Config()`). Make sure these steps are present and correctly configured in your current project to meet USART1's needs.

   Check for Conflicts: Ensure no conflicts with other peripherals using PB6 and PB7. Since you've mentioned disabling TIM4, also ensure that TIM4 is not initialized or interfering with GPIO settings.

5. Function Calls in `main.c`

   Initialization Call: In your current project's `main.c`, ensure there's a call to `MX_USART1_UART_Init()` (or equivalent) at the appropriate place in the initialization sequence, after HAL and clock configurations.

6. Optional: Interrupt and Callback Configuration

   If USART1 is used in interrupt mode, also migrate NVIC settings and interrupt handler functions. This includes enabling USART1 interrupts in the NVIC and defining the `USART1_IRQHandler` function.

Example Modifications

Without direct access to the files, here's a generic example snippet that might resemble the USART1 initialization code you need to migrate:

```c
/* Enable Peripheral Clocks */
__HAL_RCC_USART1_CLK_ENABLE();
__HAL_RCC_GPIOB_CLK_ENABLE();

/* Configure GPIO for USART1 TX (PB6) and RX (PB7) */
GPIO_InitTypeDef GPIO_InitStruct = {0};
GPIO_InitStruct.Pin = GPIO_PIN_6 | GPIO_PIN_7;
GPIO_InitStruct.Mode = GPIO_MODE_AF_PP;
GPIO_InitStruct.Pull = GPIO_NOPULL;
GPIO_InitStruct.Speed = GPIO_SPEED_FREQ_VERY_HIGH;
GPIO_InitStruct.Alternate = GPIO_AF7_USART1;
HAL_GPIO_Init(GPIOB, &GPIO_InitStruct);

/* USART1 Initialization */
UART_HandleTypeDef huart1;
huart1.Instance = USART1;
huart1.Init.BaudRate = 115200;
huart1.Init.WordLength = UART_WORDLENGTH_8B;
huart1.Init.StopBits = UART_STOPBITS_1;
huart1.Init.Parity = UART_PARITY_NONE;
huart1.Init.Mode = UART_MODE_TX_RX;
huart1.Init.HwFlowCtl = UART_HWCONTROL_NONE;
huart1.Init.OverSampling = UART_OVERSAMPLING_16;
if (HAL_UART_Init(&huart1) != HAL_OK)
{
    Error_Handler();
}
```
